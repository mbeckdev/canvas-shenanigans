HTML5 canvas shenanigans
[See it here](https://mbeckdev.github.io/canvas-shenanigans/)

I want to make sweet looking animated backgrounds and need to learn some canvas. Legends speak of the most concise, to the point, and satisfying tutorial ever created. I'm following it, it's by Chris Courses [HTML5 Canvas Tutorials for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL&index=1)  I got through the fourth video and made this blob interactable thing.  So cool that when I showed it to some friends, they told me I was becoming too powerful lol.

For the future I'm aiming for a bunch of moving dots with lines connecting them as they get closer to each other. I feel confident now to make what I want. Maybe I'll add a few different designs on different html pages ... then I can come back to this to see all my progress and different designs.
