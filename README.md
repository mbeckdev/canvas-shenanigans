HTML5 canvas shenanigans

I want to make sweet looking animated backgrounds and need to learn some canvas.

I'm following this tutorial series by Chris Courses [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL&index=1](HTML5 Canvas Tutorials for Beginners) but I might add more onto it, or maybe learn enough to make my own.

I'm aiming for a bunch of moving dots with lines connecting them as they get closer to each other. I'm hoping this will give me enough canvas skills to learn how to do that.
